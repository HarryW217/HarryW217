### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Harry and I am a Software Developer! 

I have recently graduated from the Northcoders' Software Development Bootcamp, where I learned JavaScript, HTML and CSS. In addition, I have learned Python and Typescript! I am thrilled to be on this exciting journey.

I have recently finished my Portfolio website and I am about to start populating it with more projects. Stay tuned!

Fun fact: I love Doctor Who. Pronouns: he/him.
