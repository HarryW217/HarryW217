### Hi there 👋
My name is Harry and I am a Software Developer! 

I have recently graduated from the Northcoders' Software Development Bootcamp, where I learned JavaScript, HTML and CSS. In addition, I am learning Python and Typescript! I am thrilled to be on this exciting journey.

`What am I up to right now?`: I am currently building a Python/Flask application, and I am building a Chess game using Python and Pygame!

`Fun fact`: I love Doctor Who

`Pronouns`: he/him
